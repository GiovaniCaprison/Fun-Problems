LengthOfLoan is a recursive program which takes in the loan that needs to be paid off (e.g. €250,000), the annual interest rate (e.g. 3%) and the monthly loan 
repayment (e.g. €1,600) and calculates how long the loan will take to pay off.

A student can only pass a course so long as they meet the following lab attendance criteria:
• They missed fewer than 2 labs
• They were never late for 3 consecutive labs
Demonstrators record a string representing a student’s track record – ‘A’ for absent, ‘L’ for late, ‘P’ for present
PassOrFail is a recursive program that takes in one of these strings and outputs whether the student should fail or not.
