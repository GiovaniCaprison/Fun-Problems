My A* algorithm solution to the week 10 "Escape From Maze" lab 

You are allowed 200 moves in the maze before you die. 

You will appear at some point in the maze but you don't know where. 

Each maze has exactly one exit.

Each maze is a 20x20 grid consisting of walls and spaces. 

The input reads in the maze structure from a series of 20 Strings, followed by two int co-ordinates, giving your X and Y positions in the 20x20 maze.

The program should print out the maze every time you make a step and then pause for 100ms. 

If you move into a wall nothing happens, but you lose a life. 

The program should terminate if you find the exit or lose all your lives.
