Implented my own linked list in rust.

The user is prompted to keep inputting words. Every time they enter a new word, a new link is created storing that word, and it is added to the head of the linked list.

When the user finally enters “END”, the program traverses the linked list (starting at the head) and prints out every word in it.

The interaction willlook like this:

Enter a word: Maynooth

Enter a word: is

Enter a word: great!

Enter a word: END

great!

is

Maynooth
