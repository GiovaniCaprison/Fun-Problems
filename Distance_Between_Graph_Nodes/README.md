We take user input which specifies a node to start at.

From that user input, we print the number of steps it will take to reach each of the other nodes on the graph (-1 if the node cannot be reached)

For example:

Enter the vertex to start at: A

Distance from A to A: 0

Distance from A to B: 1

Distance from A to C: 5

Distance from A to D: 3

Distance from A to E: 2

Distance from A to F: 1

Distance from A to G: 3

Distance from A to H: 4

Distance from A to I: 2

Distance from A to J: 4
