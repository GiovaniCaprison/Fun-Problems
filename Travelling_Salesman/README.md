There are 100 houses waiting for a pizza. 

The distance in metres between each house and every other house is shown in deliveries.csv.

This program finds a route that gets you from Apache Pizza to every other house and then back to Apache Pizza for your next delivery load.

It keeps track of the total distance travelled and prints it out.
