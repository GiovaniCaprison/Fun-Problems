Implement my own binary tree in rust.

We can insert numbers to the binary tree, it is also fully traversable.

The console will prompt the user for the numbers which they want to insert seperated with commas.

Example input: 8,2,54,5,6,3,66,433,24,456

The console will then return how many levels the given binary tree has.

Example output: The binary tree has 5 levels.
